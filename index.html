                <p>Hey my name is Hannah Williams and this is my story.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I have been in the mining industry for the past 9 years, in particular the fixed plant. But, for the last 3.5 years I've been based here in Brisbane in a control centre where we control most all aspects of a coal mine autonomously.

                    <br>

                    Apart from working my life revolves around my two dogs Anouk and Sherman. My husband and I have had Anouk since she was a puppy (she is 4 now) and we rescued Sherman from the RSPCA where he was rescued from a puppy farm. We got him when he was almost 5 and is living his best life now (currently 8).

                    <br>

                    I also <em>LOVE</em> plants and horticulture and have been working on my balcony oasis here in Brisbane whilst sipping cups of tea and wine.
